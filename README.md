Machine Learning on Human Activity Recognition

## Summary
This project is about Human Activity Recognition

## Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. 

## Goal of this project
The goal for this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the “classe” variable in the training set. Any of the other variables may be used to predict with. The accelerometers variables on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell are used to predict. This document contains: - how the model is built - the cross validation - expected out of sample error - prediction of 20 different test cases
